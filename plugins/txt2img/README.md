![txt2img](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/assets/12500356/7634a6f8-717c-4435-b034-58b50766199b)

This plugin is a Python plugin that allows you to generate images from text
prompts and add them directly into your dataset.

It demonstrates how to do the following:

-   use Python to create an operator with different options depending on user
    choices
-   use `componentProps` to customize the UI
-   download images from URL and add them to the dataset

:warning: This plugin is only verified to work for local datasets. It may not
work for remote datasets.

### Supported Models

This version of the plugin supports the following models:

-   [DALL-E2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2)
-   [Stable Diffusion](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion)
-   [VQGAN-CLIP](https://replicate.com/mehdidc/feed_forward_vqgan_clip)

It is straightforward to add support for other models!

## Installation

```shell
fiftyone plugins download \
    https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins \
    --plugin-names @voxel51/txt2img
```

If you want to use Replicate models (Stable Diffusion and VQGAN-CLIP), you will
need to `pip install replicate` and set the environment variable
`REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` with your API token.

If you want to use DALL-E2, you will need to `pip install openai` and set the
environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your API key.

Refer to the [main README](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins) for
